## Experience

### Fuse Integration, San Diego - Senior Software Engineer
**July 2022 - Present**

- Automated deployment to QA environment of front-end and back-end applications with nightly end-to-end integration test pipeline, improving synchronization and reliability.
- Co-led DevOps efforts in transitioning from git submodules to a Conan build architecture, resulting in faster C++ build times and easier usage of third-party libraries.
- Contributed to a C++ database synchronization application built on PostgreSQL. Initiated code testing with GoogleTest, raising repo coverage from 0% to 70%.
- Transitioned Fuse product to configure from a database instead of a JSON file, allowing front-end users to make persistent configuration changes.
- Provided analysis, recommendations, and bash scripts to improve testing coverage across multiple C++ library packages and products.
- Maintained code infrastructure with CMake, CI/CD YAML, and build/install bash scripts.
- Researched and recommended improvements to the data processing and graphing repo. Converted Python scripts to a library of functions and set up a JupyterHub server for company-wide use.

### Fuse Integration, San Diego - Software Engineer II
**February 2022 - July 2022**

- Designed and developed Python Swagger REST-API for virtual radios.
- Led scrums and sprint planning for the virtual network testbed team.

### Arizona Center for Mathematical Sciences, Tucson - Research Assistant
**January 2011 - January 2014**

- Researched and modeled nonlinear optical pulse propagation, including building a parallelized C++ simulator.
- Created a numerical method for solving nonlinear PDEs.
- Published work in peer-reviewed journals with 250+ citations.
- Collaborated with postdocs and researchers on journal articles.

### University of Arizona, Tucson - Teaching Assistant
**August 2009 - January 2011**

- Taught intro to algebra courses to undergraduates for three semesters.
- Lectured, held office hours, graded homework, and created exams.

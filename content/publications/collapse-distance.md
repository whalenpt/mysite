abstract: "We analyze the method of moving focus to determine the critical power for self-focusing by means of numerical simulation and a semianalytical model. It is shown that the original interpretation of a moving focus experiment does not hold in general and that inclusion of defocusing effects due to free electrons is necessary to relate the measured data to critical power."

## Summary

The original interpretation of a moving focus experiment does not hold in general and that inclusion of defocusing effects due to plasma is necessary to relate measured data to critical power.
